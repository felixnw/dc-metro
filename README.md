# Washington DC Metro Train Sign
This project contains the source code to create your own Washington DC Metro sign. It was written using CircuitPython targeting the [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) and is optimized for 64x32 RGB LED matrices.

# Differences
Compared to metro-sign's original version, this branch forks GJT-34 changes that include a better font, car numbers, network error catching, among other improvements. My changes from that version are simply updating the lib files, and adding simple functionality to turn off the display if there are no trains arriving. This means that at night or during maintenance the screen will no longer be on.

# How To
## Hardware
- An [Adafruit Matrix Portal Starter Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4812)
OR
- An [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) - $24.99
- A **64x32 RGB LED matrix** compatible with the _Matrix Portal_ - $39.99 _to_ $84.99
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 3mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2279)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 4mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2278)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 5mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 6mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2276)
- A **USB-C power supply** (15w phone adapters should work fine for this code, but the panels can theoretically pull 20w if every pixel is on white)
- A **USB-C cable** that can connect your computer/power supply to the board

## Tools
- A small phillips head screwdriver
- A hot glue gun _(optional)_
- Tape _(optional)_
- Zip ties _(optional)_

## Part 1: Prepare the Board
1. Use a hot glue gun to cover the sharp screws on the right-hand side of the 64x32 LED matrix, if present. This step is optional, but it will prevent wire chafing later on.

2. Lightly screw in the phillips head screws into the posts on the _Matrix Portal_. These only need to go down about 60% of the way.

3. Using the power cable provided with 64x32 matrix, slide the prong for the **red power cable** between the post and the screw on the port labeled **5v**. Tighten down this screw all the way using your screwdriver. Repeat the same for the **black power cable** and the **GND** port.

4. Connect the _Matrix Portal_ to the large connector on the left-hand side of the back of the 64x32 matrix.

5. Plug one of the power connectors into the right-hand side of the 64x32 matrix.

6. You can use tape or zip ties to prevent the cables from flopping around.

## Part 2: Loading the Software
1. Connect the board to your computer using a USB-C cable. Double click the button on the board labeled _RESET_. The board should mount onto your computer as a storage volume, most likely named _MATRIXBOOT_.
    
    ![Matrix Connected via USB](img/usb-connected.jpg)

2. Flash your _Matrix Portal_ with the latest release of CircuitPython 8.
    - Download the [firmware from Adafruit](https://circuitpython.org/board/matrixportal_m4/).
    - Drag the downloaded _.uf2_ file into the root of the _MATRIXBOOT_ volume.
    - The board will automatically flash the version of CircuitPython and remount as _CIRCUITPY_.
    - If something goes wrong, refer to the [Adafruit Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4/install-circuitpython).
  
3. Download this repository as a ZIP file by selecting the green 'Code' button at the top of this page, and then unzip the file.

4. Extract the _lib_ folder from _lib.zip_ file from this repository into the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume. There should be one folder named _lib_, with a plethora of files underneath.
    NOTE: If you're doing this in the future with a newer version of CircuitPython, you might need to update these files. If you get an blinking red green light or a console message about .mpy files, then the folders in lib will need to be replaced with current versions from the [CircuitPython site](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

6. Copy all of the Python files from the downloaded repository into the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume, and also copy _Metroesque.bdf_ into the _lib_ folder referred to earler.

7. The board might now light up with a loading screen or will just be a black screen, but we've still got some work to do.

## Part 3: Getting a WMATA API Key
1. Create a WMATA developer account on [WMATA's Developer Website](https://developer.wmata.com/signup/).

2. After your account is created, add the _Default Tier_ subscription to your account on [this page](https://developer.wmata.com/products/5475f1b0031f590f380924fe).

3. After doing this, you will be redirected to [your profile](https://developer.wmata.com/developer).

4. Under the _Subscriptions_ section on your profile, select the **show** button beside the _Primary Key_. This is the key that allows the board to communicate with WMATA.

## Part 4: Configuring the Board
1. Open the [config.py](src/config.py) file located in the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume.

2. Fill in your WiFi SSID and password under the **Network Configuration** section.

3. Under the **Metro Configuration** section:
    - Select your station and lines from the [Metro Station Codes table](#dc-metro-station-codes), and set the _metro_station_code_ value to the corresponding value in the table.
    
    - For _train_group_, the value needs to be either **'1'** or **'2'** or  **'3'**. This determines which platform's arrival times will be displayed. These typically fall in line with the values provided in the [Train Group table](#train-group-explanations), although single tracking and other events can cause these to change.
    
    - For _show_all_groups_if_nothing_else_, the value needs to be either ***True*** or ***False***. This determines what the board should do if there are no trains with assigned lines in your selected group. If True, the board will attempt to show results from all groups instead. This can help during single-tracking, when one group is temporarily reassigned to the other. If False, it will show the results from the selected group, which at most will consist of 'No Psngr' trains with no assigned lines.
    
    - Set the _metro_api_key_ value to the API key you got from [Part 3](#part-3-getting-a-wmata-api-key).

4. At the end, the first part of your configuration file should look similar this:

```python
#########################
# Network Configuration #
#########################

# WIFI Network SSID
'wifi_ssid': 'Pretty_fly_for_a_wifi',

# WIFI Password
'wifi_password': 'Panic!_at_the_cisco',

#########################
# Metro Configuration   #
#########################

# Metro Station Code
'metro_station_code': 'D02',

# Metro Train Group
'train_group': '2',

# Show All Groups If Nothing Else to Show
'show_all_groups_if_nothing_else': True,

# API Key for WMATA
'metro_api_key': 'd3adb33fd3adb33fd3adb33f',
```

5. After you save this file, your board should refresh and connect to WMATA.

## Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong, take a peek at the [Adafruit Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4). Additionally, you can connect to the board using a serial connection to gain access to its logging.
